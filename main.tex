\section{Introduction}
This document contains the specifications for a operational information system (OIS) for the Cosy Koala restaurant in Hawthorn Vic. This document will outline the specifications, requirement and quality attributes of the operational information system

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to detail the functionalities and features of the OIS, aiming to streamline various restaurant operations as the business grows. From customer management and interactions to internal services and task management, the goal of this system is to allow the Cosy Koala to operate at a targeted customer patronage of 150 guests.

\subsection{Scope}
The OIS will facilitate the following high level tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Customer Management.
    \item Customer Interaction.
    \item Internal Services.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Project Overview}
The Cosy Koala currently sits 50 customers. It is making a physical expansion on premises to sit 150 customers. The current technical integration with operations is low. Taking orders from guest and interacting with the kitchen, and accounting is handled by hand.
The Cosy Koala has identified multiple ideas they would like to include in the OIS:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The new system shall support reservations.
    \item The new system shall support taking orders from customers.
    \item The new system shall support information sharing with the Kitchen.
    \item The new system shall support creating invoices.
    \item The new system shall support creating receipts for customers.
    \item The new system shall support handling payments.
    \item The new system shall support basic statistics about ordered menu items.
    \item The new system shall support online availability of the menu.
    \item The new system shall support ordering from online take-away menus.
    \item The new system shall possibly support arranging delivery.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Domain Vocabulary}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item OIS : Operation Information System.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Pain Points}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Organize orders.
        \item Make sure food is sent to correct customer.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Administrative functions:

\subsection{Project Goals \normalsize\textbf{Author: Vincent}}
\subsubsection{Primary Goals}
The primary Goal of Cosy Koala and the reason for releasing a tender for an OIS software provider is to be able to support a physical increase of guest from 50 to 150 in their restaurant.
\subsubsection{Secondary Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Support increased business through take-away.
    \item Support informed customers through their website.
    \item Support informed management about the customers purchases.
    \item Capture potential customers through their website.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Tertiary Goals}
Cosy Koala is interested in the possibility of supporting the arrangement of delivery.

\subsection{Assumptions \normalsize\textbf{Author: Vincent}}
A number of assumptions are made in relation to the implementation of this OIS is that manual scaling of operations are impossible. Whether that means no more staff will be available. Or whether staff will be expected to have other duties.
